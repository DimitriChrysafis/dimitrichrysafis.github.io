# Wrote up my own little blog

I didnt want to just use some blog template so I fired up the HTML nuerons which
haven't been used since 2018 to slap together this little site. There's a little 
easter egg if you hit P on the home page. Quite proud I got this working and i'm happy 
with it got so far. Hopefully it doesn't become a dead project. 
  
<br />

If someone wants to post something just make a pull request to github i'll post it

<br />


Below is a visualization I made to give you an overview of what's coming up. 
I plan on posting some project material as well as personal stuff.
Just for myself.
