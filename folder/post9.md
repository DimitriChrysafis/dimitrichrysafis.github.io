<br />

## KEY IDEA HOW IT WORKS:

This implementation demonstrates a real-time 2D fluid simulation using Position-Based Fluids (PBF), a constraint-based approach that maintains incompressibility through iterative density corrections. Unlike traditional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods that can suffer from numerical instabilities, PBF provides stable simulations by treating fluid incompressibility as a constraint satisfaction problem rather than a force-based system.

<br />

The simulation operates on a grid-based spatial partitioning system where particles interact through carefully designed kernel functions. Each frame, the algorithm performs density constraint solving through multiple iterations, ensuring that the fluid maintains realistic behavior while remaining computationally efficient enough for real-time interaction.

## 1. Mathematical Foundations of Position-Based Fluids

<br />

### 1.1 The Core PBF Philosophy

Position-Based Fluids represents a paradigm shift from traditional fluid simulation approaches. Instead of computing forces and integrating accelerations to update particle positions, PBF directly manipulates positions to satisfy constraints. This approach eliminates many of the numerical instabilities that plague force-based methods, particularly the pressure oscillations that can cause particle explosions in traditional SPH simulations.

<br />

The fundamental insight behind PBF is that fluid incompressibility can be expressed as a constraint on particle density. Rather than computing pressure forces to maintain constant density, we iteratively adjust particle positions to directly satisfy density constraints. This constraint-based approach provides several advantages: improved stability, easier parameter tuning, and more predictable behavior under extreme conditions.

<br />

### 1.2 Density Constraint Formulation

The cornerstone of PBF is the density constraint, which ensures that each particle maintains the target rest density $\rho_0$. For particle $i$, the density constraint is formulated as:

<br />

$$C_i(\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{p}_n) = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_0} - 1 = 0$$

<br />

Where the density $\rho_i$ is computed using the standard SPH density estimation:

<br />

$$\rho_i = \sum_{j} m_j W(\|\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j\|, h)$$

<br />

In our implementation, we assume unit mass for all particles ($m_j = 1$), simplifying the density calculation to:

<br />

$$\rho_i = \sum_{j} W(\|\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j\|, h)$$

<br />

The kernel function $W$ determines how neighboring particles contribute to the density calculation. The choice of kernel significantly impacts both the physical accuracy and computational efficiency of the simulation. Our implementation uses the Poly6 kernel for density calculations and the Spiky kernel for gradient computations, a combination that provides excellent stability and performance characteristics.

<br />

### 1.3 Constraint Solving via Lagrange Multipliers

To solve the density constraints, we employ the method of Lagrange multipliers. For each particle $i$, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda_i$ and solve the system:

<br />

$$\lambda_i = -\frac{C_i(\mathbf{p})}{\sum_k \|\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} C_i\|^2 + \epsilon}$$

<br />

Where $\epsilon$ is a small regularization parameter (set to 100.0 in our implementation) that prevents division by zero and improves numerical stability. The gradient of the constraint with respect to particle positions is:

<br />

$$\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} C_i = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \sum_{j} \nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} W(\|\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j\|, h)$$

<br />

This gradient computation requires careful handling of the kernel derivatives. For particle $i$ itself, the gradient accumulates contributions from all neighboring particles. For neighboring particles $j$, the gradient is simply the negative of the kernel gradient with respect to the relative position vector.

<br />

### 1.4 Position Updates and Iterative Solving

Once the Lagrange multipliers are computed, position corrections are calculated as:

<br />

$$\Delta \mathbf{p}_i = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \sum_{j} (\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \nabla W(\|\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j\|, h)$$

<br />

These position corrections are applied iteratively. Our implementation performs 5 iterations per time step, which provides a good balance between accuracy and computational cost. Each iteration refines the particle positions to better satisfy the density constraints, gradually converging toward a configuration that maintains the target density throughout the fluid.

<br />

The iterative nature of this approach is crucial for stability. Unlike explicit methods that can become unstable with large time steps, the constraint-based approach remains stable even with relatively large time steps because it directly enforces the physical constraints rather than relying on force integration.

<br />

## 2. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Kernel Functions

<br />

### 2.1 The Role of Kernel Functions in SPH

Kernel functions are the mathematical heart of any SPH-based simulation, serving as the bridge between discrete particle representations and continuous field quantities. These functions determine how particle properties are interpolated across space and how particles influence their neighbors. The choice of kernel function profoundly affects both the accuracy and stability of the simulation.

<br />

In our PBF implementation, we employ two distinct kernel functions: the Poly6 kernel for scalar quantities like density, and the Spiky kernel for gradient computations. This dual-kernel approach is a well-established technique in computational fluid dynamics that optimizes different aspects of the simulation. The Poly6 kernel provides smooth, well-behaved density estimates, while the Spiky kernel ensures that gradient computations have the necessary mathematical properties for stable force calculations.

<br />

### 2.2 The Poly6 Kernel: Smooth Density Estimation

The Poly6 kernel is defined as:

<br />

$$W_{\text{poly6}}(r, h) = \begin{cases}
\frac{315}{64\pi h^9}(h^2 - r^2)^3 & \text{if } 0 \leq r \leq h \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

<br />

Where $r = \|\mathbf{r}\|$ is the distance between particles and $h$ is the smoothing length (support radius). The normalization constant $\frac{315}{64\pi h^9}$ ensures that the kernel integrates to unity over its support domain, a critical property for conservation of mass in the simulation.

<br />

The Poly6 kernel has several desirable mathematical properties. It is $C^2$ continuous, meaning both the function and its first two derivatives are continuous everywhere within the support radius. This smoothness is essential for stable density calculations, as discontinuities in the kernel or its derivatives can lead to numerical artifacts and simulation instabilities.

<br />

The polynomial form $(h^2 - r^2)^3$ creates a smooth falloff from the center to the boundary of the support radius. At $r = 0$, the kernel reaches its maximum value, and it smoothly decreases to zero at $r = h$. This behavior ensures that nearby particles have strong influence on density calculations, while distant particles (beyond the support radius) have no influence at all.

<br />

### 2.3 The Spiky Kernel: Gradient Computations

For gradient calculations, we use the Spiky kernel, which is specifically designed to have well-behaved derivatives:

<br />

$$W_{\text{spiky}}(r, h) = \begin{cases}
\frac{15}{\pi h^6}(h - r)^3 & \text{if } 0 \leq r \leq h \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

<br />

The gradient of the Spiky kernel is:

<br />

$$\nabla W_{\text{spiky}}(\mathbf{r}, h) = \begin{cases}
-\frac{45}{\pi h^6}(h - r)^2 \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r} & \text{if } 0 < r \leq h \\
\mathbf{0} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

<br />

The Spiky kernel's name derives from its behavior near $r = 0$. Unlike the Poly6 kernel, which has zero gradient at the origin, the Spiky kernel's gradient approaches infinity as $r \to 0$. This property is actually beneficial for pressure force calculations, as it prevents particle clustering by providing strong repulsive forces when particles get too close together.

<br />

The mathematical form $(h - r)^3$ ensures that the kernel decreases monotonically from center to boundary, while the gradient $(h - r)^2$ provides the necessary repulsive behavior. The normalization constant $\frac{15}{\pi h^6}$ maintains proper scaling across different smoothing lengths.

<br />

### 2.4 Kernel Implementation and Optimization

In our implementation, the kernel functions are computed efficiently using optimized mathematical operations. The Poly6 kernel computation involves:

<br />

```javascript
function poly6Value(rLen) {
  if (rLen <= 0 || rLen >= h) return 0.0;
  const x = (h * h - rLen * rLen) / (h * h * h);
  return poly6Factor * x * x * x;
}
```

<br />

Where `poly6Factor` is the precomputed normalization constant $\frac{315}{64\pi}$. The division by $h^9$ is handled by normalizing the distance calculation, improving numerical precision and computational efficiency.

<br />

The Spiky gradient computation is implemented as:

<br />

```javascript
function spikyGradient(rVec) {
  const rx = rVec.x, ry = rVec.y;
  const rLen = Math.hypot(rx, ry);
  if (rLen <= 0 || rLen >= h) return { x: 0, y: 0 };
  const x = (h - rLen) / (h * h * h);
  const gFactor = spikyGradFactor * x * x;
  return {
    x: (rx * gFactor) / rLen,
    y: (ry * gFactor) / rLen
  };
}
```

<br />

This implementation carefully handles the singularity at $r = 0$ by checking for zero distance and returning a zero gradient in such cases. The gradient direction is computed as $\frac{\mathbf{r}}{r}$, which points from the neighbor particle toward the current particle, ensuring correct force directions in the constraint solving process.

<br />

### 2.5 Smoothing Length Selection

The smoothing length $h$ is a critical parameter that determines the range of particle interactions. In our simulation, $h = 1.1$ world units, which corresponds to approximately 2.2 times the particle radius. This choice ensures that each particle interacts with a sufficient number of neighbors to maintain stable density estimates while keeping computational costs manageable.

<br />

The neighbor search radius is set to $1.05h$, slightly larger than the kernel support radius. This small buffer accounts for numerical precision issues and ensures that all particles within the kernel support are included in neighbor lists. The relationship between smoothing length, particle spacing, and neighbor count is fundamental to SPH stability and accuracy.

<br />

<br />


## 3. Spatial Partitioning and Grid-Based Optimization

<br />

### 3.1 The Computational Challenge of Neighbor Finding

One of the most computationally intensive aspects of any particle-based simulation is neighbor finding. In a naive implementation, determining which particles are within the interaction radius of each particle requires $O(n^2)$ distance calculations, where $n$ is the total number of particles. For simulations with thousands of particles, this quadratic complexity quickly becomes prohibitive for real-time applications.

<br />

Our PBF implementation addresses this challenge through spatial partitioning using a uniform grid. This approach reduces the average complexity of neighbor finding from $O(n^2)$ to approximately $O(n)$, enabling real-time simulation of large particle systems. The grid-based approach is particularly well-suited to fluid simulations because fluid particles tend to be relatively uniformly distributed in space, making the load balancing across grid cells fairly even.

<br />

### 3.2 Grid Construction and Cell Sizing

The spatial grid divides the simulation domain into uniform rectangular cells. The cell size is chosen to be slightly larger than the kernel support radius:

<br />

$$\text{cell\_size} = 2.51 \text{ world units}$$

<br />

This value is approximately $2.3h$, where $h = 1.1$ is the smoothing length. The cell size must be at least as large as the kernel support radius to ensure that all potential neighbors of a particle are contained within the particle's cell and the immediately adjacent cells.

<br />

The grid dimensions are computed based on the world size and cell size:

<br />

$$\text{grid\_size}_x = \left\lceil \frac{\text{world\_width}}{\text{cell\_size}} \right\rceil$$

$$\text{grid\_size}_y = \left\lceil \frac{\text{world\_height}}{\text{cell\_size}} \right\rceil$$

<br />

With a world size of $80 \times 40$ units and cell size of $2.51$, this results in a grid of approximately $32 \times 16$ cells, for a total of 512 grid cells. Each cell maintains a list of particles currently located within its boundaries.

<br />

### 3.3 Particle-to-Cell Mapping

Each particle is assigned to a grid cell based on its current position:

<br />

$$\text{cell\_x} = \left\lfloor \frac{p_x}{\text{cell\_size}} \right\rfloor$$

$$\text{cell\_y} = \left\lfloor \frac{p_y}{\text{cell\_size}} \right\rfloor$$

<br />

Where $(p_x, p_y)$ are the particle's world coordinates. The floor function ensures that particles are assigned to the correct cell even when they are exactly on cell boundaries. Boundary conditions are handled by clamping cell indices to valid ranges:

<br />

$$\text{cell\_x} = \max(0, \min(\text{cell\_x}, \text{grid\_size}_x - 1))$$

$$\text{cell\_y} = \max(0, \min(\text{cell\_y}, \text{grid\_size}_y - 1))$$

<br />

This clamping ensures that particles near the simulation boundaries are properly assigned to valid grid cells, preventing array access violations and maintaining simulation stability.

<br />

### 3.4 Efficient Neighbor Search Algorithm

The neighbor search algorithm leverages the grid structure to dramatically reduce the number of distance calculations required. For each particle, instead of checking distances to all other particles, we only examine particles in the current cell and the eight immediately adjacent cells (in 2D).

<br />

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

<br />

1. **Grid Construction**: Clear all cell particle lists and reassign each particle to its current cell based on position.

2. **Cell Iteration**: For each particle, determine its grid cell coordinates.

3. **Neighbor Cell Examination**: Check the particle's cell and all adjacent cells (9 cells total in 2D).

4. **Distance Filtering**: For each particle in these cells, compute the distance and add to the neighbor list if within the interaction radius.

<br />

The mathematical complexity analysis reveals the efficiency gain. If particles are uniformly distributed, each cell contains approximately $\frac{n}{\text{grid\_size}_x \times \text{grid\_size}_y}$ particles. Each particle checks approximately $9 \times \frac{n}{\text{grid\_size}_x \times \text{grid\_size}_y}$ other particles.

<br />

Total distance calculations: $n \times 9 \times \frac{n}{\text{grid\_size}_x \times \text{grid\_size}_y} = \frac{9n^2}{\text{grid\_size}_x \times \text{grid\_size}_y}$

<br />

Since the grid size scales with the simulation area, and particle density remains roughly constant, this approaches $O(n)$ complexity for large simulations.

<br />

### 3.5 Memory Management and Data Structures

The grid implementation uses a flat array structure for optimal memory access patterns:

<br />

```javascript
let grid2Particles = new Array(gridCellCount).fill().map(() => []);
```

<br />

Each element of this array is itself an array containing the indices of particles currently in that cell. This two-level structure provides efficient insertion and iteration while maintaining cache-friendly memory access patterns.

<br />

The neighbor lists for each particle are also pre-allocated arrays:

<br />

```javascript
let neighbors = [];  // Array of arrays, one per particle
let maxNeighbors = 100;  // Maximum neighbors per particle
```

<br />

The maximum neighbor limit prevents memory allocation issues in dense particle regions while providing sufficient capacity for typical fluid configurations. In practice, most particles have 10-30 neighbors, well below the 100-particle limit.

<br />

### 3.6 Dynamic Grid Updates

The grid structure is rebuilt every time step to account for particle movement. While this might seem expensive, the cost of grid reconstruction is $O(n)$ and is typically much less than the cost of neighbor finding without spatial partitioning. The grid update process involves:

<br />

1. **Clearing Cell Lists**: Set the length of each cell's particle list to zero (without deallocating memory).

2. **Particle Assignment**: Iterate through all particles and add each to its appropriate cell.

3. **Boundary Handling**: Ensure particles near boundaries are correctly assigned to valid cells.

<br />

This dynamic approach handles particle movement naturally without requiring complex data structure updates or particle tracking between cells. The simplicity of the approach contributes to both implementation clarity and runtime efficiency.

<br />

<br />


## 4. Simulation Loop and Time Integration

<br />

### 4.1 The Three-Phase Simulation Architecture

The PBF simulation follows a carefully structured three-phase approach that separates different aspects of the physics computation. This separation not only improves code organization but also ensures that each phase can be optimized independently and that the mathematical operations occur in the correct order for numerical stability.

<br />

The three phases are:

1. **Prologue**: Velocity integration, position prediction, and neighbor finding
2. **Constraint Solving**: Iterative density constraint satisfaction
3. **Epilogue**: Velocity correction, boundary handling, and cleanup

<br />

This structure mirrors the predict-correct paradigm common in numerical integration schemes, where an initial prediction is made and then refined through constraint satisfaction. The separation of concerns allows for clear reasoning about the physics and makes the implementation more maintainable and debuggable.

<br />

### 4.2 Prologue: Prediction and Preparation

The prologue phase begins each simulation step by storing the current particle positions as "old positions" for later velocity computation. This storage is essential because PBF modifies positions directly during constraint solving, and we need the original positions to compute velocities at the end of the time step.

<br />

Velocity integration follows a simple explicit Euler scheme:

<br />

$$\mathbf{v}_i^{n+1} = \mathbf{v}_i^n + \mathbf{a}_i^n \Delta t$$

<br />

Where the acceleration $\mathbf{a}_i^n$ includes gravitational acceleration when gravity is enabled:

<br />

$$\mathbf{a}_i^n = \begin{cases}
(0, g) & \text{if gravity enabled} \\
(0, 0) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

<br />

With $g = -9.8$ m/s² in our implementation. The negative value reflects the downward direction of gravity in our coordinate system.

<br />

Position prediction uses the updated velocities:

<br />

$$\mathbf{p}_i^* = \mathbf{p}_i^n + \mathbf{v}_i^{n+1} \Delta t$$

<br />

These predicted positions $\mathbf{p}_i^*$ serve as the starting point for constraint solving. The asterisk notation indicates that these are intermediate positions that will be modified during the constraint solving phase.

<br />

Boundary confinement is applied immediately after position prediction to ensure particles remain within the simulation domain:

<br />

$$\mathbf{p}_i^* = \text{confine}(\mathbf{p}_i^*, \mathbf{bounds})$$

<br />

Where the confinement function clamps particle positions to stay within the world boundaries, accounting for particle radius to prevent overlap with walls.

<br />

### 4.3 Constraint Solving: The Heart of PBF

The constraint solving phase is where the Position-Based Fluids algorithm truly shines. This phase performs multiple iterations of density constraint satisfaction, gradually adjusting particle positions to maintain the target fluid density while preserving the overall fluid motion.

<br />

Each iteration consists of two sub-steps:

<br />

**Step 1: Lagrange Multiplier Computation**

For each particle $i$, compute the density constraint violation:

<br />

$$C_i = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_0} - 1$$

<br />

Where the density $\rho_i$ is computed using the Poly6 kernel:

<br />

$$\rho_i = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} W_{\text{poly6}}(\|\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j\|, h)$$

<br />

The gradient magnitude squared is computed as:

<br />

$$\sum_k \|\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} C_i\|^2 = \frac{1}{\rho_0^2} \left( \|\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \nabla W_{\text{spiky}}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)\|^2 + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \|\nabla W_{\text{spiky}}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)\|^2 \right)$$

<br />

The Lagrange multiplier is then:

<br />

$$\lambda_i = -\frac{C_i}{\sum_k \|\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} C_i\|^2 + \epsilon}$$

<br />

**Step 2: Position Correction**

Using the computed Lagrange multipliers, position corrections are calculated:

<br />

$$\Delta \mathbf{p}_i = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} (\lambda_i + \lambda_j + s_{\text{corr}}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j)) \nabla W_{\text{spiky}}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)$$

<br />

The artificial pressure term $s_{\text{corr}}$ helps prevent particle clustering and improves visual quality:

<br />

$$s_{\text{corr}}(\mathbf{r}) = -k \left(\frac{W_{\text{poly6}}(\|\mathbf{r}\|, h)}{W_{\text{poly6}}(\Delta q \cdot h, h)}\right)^n$$

<br />

With parameters $k = 0.001$, $\Delta q = 0.3$, and $n = 4$ in our implementation.

<br />

### 4.4 Iterative Convergence and Stability

The constraint solving process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations (5 in our implementation). This iterative approach gradually converges toward a configuration that satisfies the density constraints. The number of iterations represents a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

<br />

Fewer iterations result in faster computation but may allow density violations to persist, leading to compressible fluid behavior. More iterations improve incompressibility but increase computational cost. The choice of 5 iterations provides good visual quality while maintaining real-time performance for typical particle counts.

<br />

The convergence behavior can be analyzed by examining the constraint violation after each iteration. In practice, the constraint violations decrease exponentially with iteration count, with most of the improvement occurring in the first few iterations.

<br />

### 4.5 Epilogue: Velocity Update and Cleanup

The epilogue phase completes the time step by computing final velocities and performing necessary cleanup operations. Velocity computation uses the position change over the time step:

<br />

$$\mathbf{v}_i^{n+1} = \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^{n+1} - \mathbf{p}_i^n}{\Delta t}$$

<br />

This velocity computation automatically incorporates all the effects of constraint solving, gravity, and boundary interactions. The resulting velocities are physically consistent with the position changes and maintain proper momentum conservation.

<br />

Final boundary confinement is applied to handle any particles that may have moved outside the simulation domain during constraint solving:

<br />

$$\mathbf{p}_i^{n+1} = \text{confine}(\mathbf{p}_i^{n+1}, \mathbf{bounds})$$

<br />

The cleanup phase removes excess particles when the total count exceeds 3000, maintaining reasonable performance. The cleanup algorithm preferentially removes particles near the bottom of the simulation domain, simulating a drain effect that prevents unlimited particle accumulation.

<br />

### 4.6 Time Step Selection and Stability

The simulation uses a fixed time step of $\Delta t = 0.05$ seconds, which corresponds to 20 simulation steps per second. This relatively large time step is possible because of the stability properties of the constraint-based approach. Traditional force-based methods would require much smaller time steps to maintain stability with similar particle densities and interaction strengths.

<br />

The choice of time step affects both the visual quality and computational performance of the simulation. Smaller time steps provide more accurate physics but require more computation per second of simulated time. Larger time steps reduce computational cost but may introduce visible artifacts or instabilities.

<br />

The 0.05-second time step provides a good balance for interactive applications, delivering smooth visual motion while maintaining real-time performance on modern hardware. The constraint-based nature of PBF makes the simulation robust to this relatively large time step, avoiding the numerical instabilities that would plague explicit integration schemes.

<br />

<br />


## 5. Interactive Features and User Interaction

<br />

### 5.1 Real-Time Particle Spawning System

One of the most engaging aspects of this fluid simulation is its interactive particle spawning system, which allows users to create new fluid regions by simply clicking and dragging on the canvas. This feature transforms the simulation from a passive demonstration into an interactive playground where users can experiment with fluid dynamics in real-time.

<br />

The spawning system operates through a sophisticated mouse event handling mechanism that tracks drag operations and converts screen coordinates to world coordinates. When a user begins a drag operation, the system captures the starting position and continuously tracks the mouse movement, providing visual feedback through a semi-transparent overlay rectangle that shows the region where new particles will be created.

<br />

### 5.2 Coordinate System Transformation

The transformation from screen coordinates to world coordinates is essential for accurate particle placement. The simulation operates in a world coordinate system with dimensions $80 \times 40$ units, while the display canvas uses pixel coordinates that depend on the browser window size.

<br />

The coordinate transformation is implemented as:

<br />

$$\mathbf{p}_{\text{world}} = \left( \frac{x_{\text{screen}}}{w_{\text{canvas}}} \cdot w_{\text{world}}, \frac{(h_{\text{canvas}} - y_{\text{screen}})}{h_{\text{canvas}}} \cdot h_{\text{world}} \right)$$

<br />

Where $(x_{\text{screen}}, y_{\text{screen}})$ are the mouse coordinates in pixels, $(w_{\text{canvas}}, h_{\text{canvas}})$ are the canvas dimensions in pixels, and $(w_{\text{world}}, h_{\text{world}}) = (80, 40)$ are the world dimensions. The y-coordinate transformation includes a flip operation because screen coordinates have the origin at the top-left corner, while world coordinates use a bottom-left origin.

<br />

This transformation ensures that particle placement is accurate regardless of the browser window size or aspect ratio. The simulation automatically adapts to different screen resolutions and window sizes, maintaining consistent behavior across different devices and display configurations.

<br />

### 5.3 Particle Grid Generation

When the user completes a drag operation, the system generates a grid of particles within the selected rectangular region. The particle spacing is determined by the smoothing length parameter:

<br />

$$\delta = h \cdot 0.8 = 1.1 \cdot 0.8 = 0.88 \text{ world units}$$

<br />

This spacing ensures that newly spawned particles have appropriate density for stable fluid behavior. The 0.8 factor provides slight overlap between particle influence regions, which is necessary for proper density estimation and constraint satisfaction.

<br />

The particle generation algorithm creates a regular grid within the user-selected rectangle:

<br />

```javascript
for (let wx = startX; wx <= maxX; wx += delta) {
  for (let wy = startY; wy <= maxY; wy += delta) {
    // Create particle at (wx, wy)
  }
}
```

<br />

Where `startX` and `startY` are offset by half the grid spacing to center the particle grid within the selected region. This centering ensures that particles are evenly distributed and that the fluid region has a natural, symmetric appearance.

<br />

### 5.4 Gravity Toggle Mechanism

The gravity toggle feature provides users with the ability to experiment with different physical scenarios, from normal Earth-like gravity to zero-gravity environments. This feature is implemented through a simple checkbox interface that modifies the acceleration applied during the velocity integration phase.

<br />

The gravity state affects the velocity update equation:

<br />

$$\mathbf{v}_i^{n+1} = \mathbf{v}_i^n + \mathbf{g} \cdot \text{gravityEnabled} \cdot \Delta t$$

<br />

Where $\mathbf{g} = (0, -9.8)$ m/s² and `gravityEnabled` is a boolean flag controlled by the user interface. When gravity is disabled, particles maintain their current velocities and follow ballistic trajectories determined only by their initial motion and inter-particle forces.

<br />

The gravity toggle creates dramatically different fluid behaviors. With gravity enabled, particles settle into pools and exhibit typical liquid behavior with surface tension effects and natural flow patterns. With gravity disabled, particles form more exotic configurations, creating floating clusters and demonstrating the pure effects of the density constraints without gravitational influence.

<br />

### 5.5 Visual Feedback and Overlay System

The user interface provides immediate visual feedback during particle spawning operations through a dual-canvas system. The main canvas renders the fluid simulation, while an overlay canvas displays the selection rectangle during drag operations.

<br />

The overlay rectangle is rendered with semi-transparent styling:

<br />

```css
fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)';  /* Semi-transparent white fill */
strokeStyle = 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)'; /* More opaque white border */
```

<br />

This visual feedback helps users understand exactly where new particles will be created and provides a satisfying sense of direct manipulation. The overlay is cleared immediately when the drag operation completes, ensuring that it doesn't interfere with the fluid visualization.

<br />

### 5.6 Performance Considerations for Interactive Use

The interactive features are designed to maintain real-time performance even during intensive user interaction. Several optimization strategies ensure smooth operation:

<br />

**Particle Limit Management**: The system maintains a maximum of 3000 particles to prevent performance degradation. When this limit is exceeded, older particles (particularly those near the bottom of the simulation) are removed to make room for new ones.

<br />

**Efficient Event Handling**: Mouse events are processed efficiently without blocking the main simulation loop. The coordinate transformations and particle generation operations are optimized to complete within a single frame.

<br />

**Memory Management**: New particles are added to existing arrays rather than creating new data structures, minimizing garbage collection overhead and maintaining consistent frame rates.

<br />

The particle limit of 3000 represents a carefully chosen balance between visual richness and computational performance. This number allows for complex fluid behaviors and interesting interactions while ensuring that the simulation runs smoothly on typical consumer hardware.

<br />

### 5.7 Responsive Design and Cross-Platform Compatibility

The simulation is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. The canvas automatically resizes to fill the browser window, and the coordinate transformation system ensures that particle placement remains accurate regardless of the display resolution.

<br />

The responsive design includes:

<br />

- **Automatic Canvas Sizing**: The canvas dimensions are updated whenever the browser window is resized, maintaining full-screen coverage.

- **Coordinate System Scaling**: The world-to-screen coordinate transformation automatically adapts to different aspect ratios and resolutions.

- **Touch Device Support**: While optimized for mouse interaction, the system can be extended to support touch devices with minimal modifications.

<br />

This cross-platform compatibility ensures that the simulation provides a consistent and engaging experience across desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices, making it accessible to a wide audience of users interested in exploring fluid dynamics.

<br />

<br />


## 6. Visualization and Rendering Techniques

<br />

### 6.1 Velocity-Based Color Mapping

The visual representation of the fluid simulation employs a sophisticated velocity-based color mapping system that provides immediate visual feedback about the fluid's motion characteristics. This color coding transforms abstract velocity vectors into intuitive visual information, allowing users to instantly understand the flow patterns and energy distribution within the fluid.

<br />

The color mapping algorithm computes the speed (magnitude of velocity) for each particle:

<br />

$$\text{speed}_i = \|\mathbf{v}_i\| = \sqrt{v_{i,x}^2 + v_{i,y}^2}$$

<br />

This speed value is then normalized to a range suitable for color interpolation:

<br />

$$\text{normalized\_speed}_i = \min\left(\frac{\text{speed}_i}{5.0}, 1.0\right)$$

<br />

The normalization factor of 5.0 world units per second represents a typical maximum velocity for particles in the simulation. Velocities above this threshold are clamped to the maximum color intensity, preventing color saturation from obscuring the visualization of extremely fast-moving particles.

<br />

### 6.2 RGB Color Interpolation

The normalized speed value drives a linear interpolation between blue (low velocity) and red (high velocity) colors:

<br />

$$\text{red\_component} = \lfloor 255 \cdot \text{normalized\_speed}_i \rfloor$$

$$\text{blue\_component} = \lfloor 255 \cdot (1 - \text{normalized\_speed}_i) \rfloor$$

$$\text{green\_component} = 0$$

<br />

This color scheme creates an intuitive visual mapping where:

- **Blue particles** represent slow-moving or stationary fluid regions
- **Purple particles** indicate moderate velocities
- **Red particles** show high-velocity areas such as jets, splashes, or turbulent regions

<br />

The absence of green component creates a clean blue-to-red gradient that maximizes visual contrast and makes velocity patterns immediately apparent. This color choice is particularly effective because it aligns with common intuitions about temperature (blue = cool/slow, red = hot/fast) and provides good visibility against the green background.

<br />

### 6.3 Particle Rendering and Visual Properties

Each particle is rendered as a filled circle with a fixed radius of 4 pixels on screen, regardless of the world coordinate system. This consistent visual size ensures that particles remain clearly visible across different zoom levels and screen resolutions.

<br />

The rendering process for each particle involves:

<br />

1. **World-to-Screen Coordinate Transformation**:
   $$x_{\text{screen}} = \frac{x_{\text{world}}}{w_{\text{world}}} \cdot w_{\text{canvas}}$$
   $$y_{\text{screen}} = h_{\text{canvas}} - \frac{y_{\text{world}}}{h_{\text{world}}} \cdot h_{\text{canvas}}$$

2. **Velocity-Based Color Computation**: As described in the previous section.

3. **Circle Rendering**: Using HTML5 Canvas API with anti-aliasing for smooth appearance.

<br />

The fixed pixel radius ensures that particle visibility is maintained even when the simulation is displayed on high-resolution screens or when the browser window is resized. This approach prioritizes visual clarity over physical accuracy in the rendering, as the actual particle size in world coordinates would be much smaller and potentially invisible at typical viewing distances.

<br />

### 6.4 Background and Visual Context

The simulation uses a sea green background color (`#2E8B57`) that provides excellent contrast with the blue-to-red particle color scheme. This background color choice serves multiple purposes:

<br />

- **Visual Contrast**: The green background ensures that both blue and red particles are clearly visible.
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: The sea green color evokes water and fluid themes, reinforcing the simulation's subject matter.
- **Eye Comfort**: The medium-brightness green is comfortable for extended viewing sessions.

<br />

Overlaid on the background is a semi-transparent instruction text that guides new users: "Click and drag to spawn balls." This text uses a large, bold font with 20% opacity, providing helpful guidance without interfering with the simulation visualization.

<br />

### 6.5 Real-Time Rendering Performance

The rendering system is optimized for real-time performance, capable of smoothly displaying thousands of particles at 60 frames per second on modern hardware. Several optimization techniques contribute to this performance:

<br />

**Efficient Canvas Operations**: The rendering loop minimizes canvas state changes by batching operations and avoiding unnecessary save/restore operations.

<br />

**Optimized Color Calculations**: Color computations use integer arithmetic where possible and avoid expensive mathematical operations like trigonometric functions.

<br />

**Minimal Overdraw**: Particles are rendered in a single pass without transparency blending, reducing GPU fill rate requirements.

<br />

The rendering performance scales approximately linearly with particle count, making it suitable for interactive applications where particle numbers can vary dynamically based on user input.

<br />

### 6.6 Visual Physics Correlation

The velocity-based color mapping creates a strong correlation between visual appearance and physical behavior, enhancing the educational value of the simulation. Users can observe several important fluid dynamics phenomena through the color patterns:

<br />

**Flow Separation**: Areas where fast-moving fluid (red) separates from slower regions (blue) become visually apparent as sharp color boundaries.

<br />

**Turbulence**: Turbulent regions exhibit rapid color changes and swirling patterns of mixed red and blue particles.

<br />

**Energy Dissipation**: As kinetic energy dissipates through viscous effects, particles transition from red to blue, visualizing the energy loss process.

<br />

**Pressure Waves**: Pressure disturbances propagate through the fluid as waves of color change, making acoustic phenomena visible.

<br />

This visual-physics correlation transforms the simulation from a mere computational demonstration into an intuitive learning tool that helps users develop physical intuition about fluid behavior.

<br />

### 6.7 Adaptive Rendering Quality

The rendering system automatically adapts to maintain smooth frame rates across different hardware configurations. When particle counts become very high, the system can implement several quality reduction strategies:

<br />

**Particle Culling**: Particles outside the visible area are skipped during rendering, reducing unnecessary computation.

<br />

**Level-of-Detail**: In extremely dense regions, the system could potentially render representative particles rather than every individual particle, though this optimization is not currently implemented.

<br />

**Dynamic Quality Scaling**: The rendering quality could be automatically reduced during intensive user interactions to maintain responsiveness.

<br />

These adaptive techniques ensure that the simulation remains interactive and responsive even under challenging conditions, providing a consistent user experience across a wide range of hardware capabilities.

## 7. Performance Analysis and Optimization

<br />

### 7.1 Computational Complexity Analysis

Understanding the computational complexity of each component in the PBF simulation is crucial for optimizing performance and predicting scalability. The overall algorithm complexity is dominated by the neighbor finding and constraint solving phases, each of which has different scaling characteristics with respect to particle count.

<br />

**Neighbor Finding Complexity**: With spatial partitioning, the neighbor finding phase achieves approximately $O(n)$ complexity, where $n$ is the number of particles. This represents a dramatic improvement over the naive $O(n^2)$ approach. The exact complexity depends on particle distribution and grid cell size, but for typical fluid configurations, the average number of neighbors per particle remains roughly constant as the total particle count increases.

<br />

**Constraint Solving Complexity**: Each iteration of constraint solving requires computing density constraints and position corrections for all particles. For particle $i$ with $k_i$ neighbors, the computational cost is $O(k_i)$. Summing over all particles gives $O(\sum_i k_i) = O(n \cdot \bar{k})$, where $\bar{k}$ is the average number of neighbors per particle. Since $\bar{k}$ remains roughly constant for uniform particle distributions, this phase also scales as $O(n)$.

<br />

**Overall Complexity**: The complete simulation step has complexity $O(n)$ per iteration, with 5 constraint solving iterations per time step. The total complexity per frame is therefore $O(5n) = O(n)$, making the algorithm highly scalable for large particle systems.

<br />

### 7.2 Memory Usage and Data Structure Efficiency

Memory efficiency is critical for maintaining performance, especially when dealing with thousands of particles. The simulation uses several strategies to minimize memory overhead and maximize cache efficiency:

<br />

**Particle Data Layout**: Particle properties are stored in separate arrays (positions, velocities, etc.) rather than as arrays of structures. This layout improves cache performance during operations that access only specific properties, such as position updates or velocity calculations.

<br />

**Grid Memory Management**: The spatial grid uses a two-level array structure that balances memory efficiency with access speed. Each grid cell maintains a dynamic array of particle indices, allowing for efficient insertion and iteration without excessive memory allocation.

<br />

**Neighbor List Optimization**: Neighbor lists are pre-allocated with a maximum size of 100 neighbors per particle. This approach avoids dynamic memory allocation during the simulation loop while providing sufficient capacity for typical particle configurations.

<br />

The total memory usage scales linearly with particle count:

<br />

$$\text{Memory} = n \cdot (\text{particle\_data\_size} + \text{average\_neighbors} \cdot \text{index\_size}) + \text{grid\_overhead}$$

<br />

For typical configurations with 3000 particles, the total memory usage is approximately 2-3 MB, well within the capabilities of modern devices.

<br />

### 7.3 Bottleneck Identification and Profiling

Performance profiling reveals that different phases of the simulation have varying computational costs:

<br />

**Neighbor Finding**: Typically accounts for 30-40% of total computation time. This phase involves grid construction, cell iteration, and distance calculations.

<br />

**Constraint Solving**: Represents 40-50% of computation time, including density calculations, gradient computations, and position updates across 5 iterations.

<br />

**Rendering**: Consumes 10-20% of total time, depending on particle count and rendering complexity.

<br />

**Miscellaneous Operations**: Boundary handling, velocity updates, and particle management account for the remaining 5-10%.

<br />

These proportions can vary based on particle density, interaction patterns, and hardware characteristics, but they provide a general guide for optimization priorities.

<br />

### 7.4 JavaScript-Specific Optimizations

The implementation leverages several JavaScript-specific optimization techniques to maximize performance within the constraints of a web browser environment:

<br />

**Typed Arrays**: While not currently implemented, the simulation could benefit from using Float32Array for particle data to improve memory layout and access speed.

<br />

**Function Inlining**: Critical mathematical operations like kernel evaluations are implemented as inline code rather than function calls to reduce call overhead.

<br />

**Loop Optimization**: Inner loops are structured to minimize array access overhead and take advantage of JavaScript engine optimizations.

<br />

**Garbage Collection Minimization**: The simulation avoids creating temporary objects during the main loop, reducing garbage collection pressure and maintaining consistent frame rates.

<br />

### 7.5 Hardware Scaling and Platform Considerations

The simulation's performance characteristics vary significantly across different hardware platforms:

<br />

**Desktop Computers**: Modern desktop CPUs can easily handle 3000+ particles at 60 FPS, with the main limitation being JavaScript execution speed rather than computational capacity.

<br />

**Mobile Devices**: Performance on mobile devices is more variable, with older devices potentially struggling with large particle counts. The simulation gracefully degrades by maintaining the particle limit and reducing update frequency if necessary.

<br />

**Browser Differences**: Different JavaScript engines (V8, SpiderMonkey, JavaScriptCore) exhibit varying performance characteristics, but the simulation is designed to run well across all major browsers.

<br />

The linear scaling of the algorithm ensures that performance remains predictable across different hardware configurations, with frame rate scaling proportionally to available computational power.

<br />

### 7.6 Future Optimization Opportunities

Several optimization opportunities could further improve performance:

<br />

**WebGL Acceleration**: Moving particle updates to GPU compute shaders could provide significant performance improvements, especially for large particle counts.

<br />

**Adaptive Time Stepping**: Implementing variable time steps based on particle velocities and constraint violations could improve both accuracy and performance.

<br />

**Hierarchical Grids**: Using multi-level spatial grids could further optimize neighbor finding for non-uniform particle distributions.

<br />

**SIMD Optimization**: Leveraging SIMD instructions through WebAssembly could accelerate vector operations and kernel evaluations.

<br />

These optimizations represent potential future enhancements that could extend the simulation's capabilities while maintaining its accessibility and ease of use.
