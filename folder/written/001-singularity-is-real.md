The singularity isn’t a date on a calendar. It’s the point where “idea → working thing” gets so cheap that the bottleneck becomes taste, direction, and ruthlessness.

I think it’s already here in the small:

- You can ship software faster than you can explain it.
- The marginal cost of trying a stupid idea is basically zero.
- The limiting factor is choosing *which* problems deserve attention.

People want to argue about AGI definitions. Meanwhile the practical question is: can you turn your intent into reality without friction? That curve is going vertical.
